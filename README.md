# total recall

this mod adds a single item: the **recall pearl**. the recall pearl works just like a vanilla ender pearl, but has a few special rules:
- ten seconds after it hits something, you will **Recall** and teleport back to where you were standing when the pearl landed.
- during those ten seconds, you will receive the `Recall` effect, which acts like a timer that tells you how long you have left until you Recall.
- if, during those ten seconds, you use another recall pearl, the first Recall timer will be **put on hold** and superseded by the newer one. after your Recall from the second recall pearl, the first Recall timer will resume where it left off. This can be repeated **as many times as you like**. each time you use another recall pearl, your Recall effect will **increment by one.**
- if a recall pearl hits an entity instead of a block, in addition to starting a Recall for you, **you and the entity will swap positions**. some entities, like the ender dragon, are immune to this effect.
- if you drink a bucket of milk, die, or otherwise interrupt the Recall effect while it is counting down, **your Recall will be canceled**.

the recall pearl can be crafted using four gold ingots around an ender pearl.
